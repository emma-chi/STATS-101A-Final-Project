# STATS-101A-Final-Project

One of the most popular online battle games, League of Legends is a multiplayer battle arena game in which two opposing teams compete against one another utilizing a variety of roles, lanes, and bonuses. We used real game data to analyze team performance and develop a model for these performances. We employed multicollinearity and t-tests to assess the significance of the many variables in this dataset, then evaluated and appropriately revised our models using Bayes Information Criterion and regression diagnostics.
